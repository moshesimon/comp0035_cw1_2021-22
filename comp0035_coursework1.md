## Selection of project methodology
### Methodology (or combination) selected
Scrum
### Selection criteria and justification of selection
Criteria:
1) Needs to be a method I am already familiar with.
2) Needs to adapt well for inexperienced software developers.
I have selected the scrum methodology for a number of reasons. Firstly, I have used the scrum methodology in the past and am quite farmiliar with how it works. Secondly, this methodology fits well with this project because the web app will contain many different features and scrum allows for working on small sections of the project at a time. Scrum is also good for programmers with limited experience because it focuses on incremental improvements so we can learn along the way. It also is excellent at identifying bugs at the early stages which is useful for less experienced programmers. Scrum also allows for daily meeting for developers to voice things they are struggling with and get help.
